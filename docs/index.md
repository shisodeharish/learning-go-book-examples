# 📘 Learning Go Book – Developer Journey

Welcome to the official walkthrough of my Go language journey based on the book **"Learning Go"**. This GitHub repository is not just a code archive — it's a **living, evolving guide** to help learners and engineers understand Go fundamentals through clean, structured, and automated examples.

## 🚀 Why This Project?

I built this project to:

- Learn Go deeply, not just syntactically but idiomatically
- Practice clean architecture, tooling, and automation
- Document each chapter with professional standards
- Inspire other developers transitioning into Go from .NET or other ecosystems
