# 🧪 Program: Hello World

This is the first example from **Chapter 1** of the _Learning Go_ book. It demonstrates how to:

- Set up a basic Go project using `go mod`
- Create a simple `main.go` file that prints "Hello, world!"
- Use Go tooling: `go fmt`, `go vet`, `go build`
- Run and test your program using a `Makefile`

## 🏁 How to Run

```bash
make run
```

## 🛠️ Commands Available

- `make fmt` → Format code
- `make vet` → Static analysis
- `make build` → Build binary
- `make run` → Run the program
- `make clean` → Remove binary
