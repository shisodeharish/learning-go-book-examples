# ðŸ§  Learning Diary â€“ Go Developer Journey

Welcome to my enterprise-level learning diary while working through the **"Learning Go"** book and evolving real-world, production-grade Go applications. This document captures insights, roadblocks, architectural reflections, and best practices applied at each stage.

## ðŸš€ Purpose of This Diary

- Track learning milestones chapter by chapter  
- Capture key implementation decisions  
- Reflect on Go idioms, CLI behavior, and tooling  
- Document how this learning shapes enterprise-level systems

## âœ… Chapter 1: Setting Up Your Go Environment

### ðŸ”§ What I Set Up:
- Installed Go 1.22 on both **Windows (via Chocolatey)** and **Linux (via tarball)**
- Verified the Go installation using `go version`
- Created a new Go module using `go mod init hello_world`
- Wrote a basic "Hello, world!" program
- Built and ran the binary using both `go build` and `go run`
- Introduced a `Makefile` to automate build, format, vet, and clean targets
- Configured GitHub Actions CI to lint and build automatically on push

---

### ðŸ’¡ Key Learnings:

- **Go is opinionated** â€” it enforces tabs, formatting (`go fmt`), and canonical structure which helps with maintainability.
- **Makefiles in Go projects** improve developer experience, allow CI integration, and standardize workflow even in small projects.
- **Go Compatibility Promise** ensures long-term code stability across Go 1.x versions â€” essential for enterprise planning.
- **Chocolatey** provides a reliable, scriptable way to install Go, `make`, and other dev tools on Windows.
- **VS Code** with the Go extension is highly productive for debugging, formatting, and linting with Delve and `gopls`.

| VS Code            | Editor with Go plugin (`gopls`, Delve)  |
| GitHub Actions     | CI integration with Go workflows         |
| Make               | Automating formatting, build, clean      |
| Terminal / Shell   | Execution of Go and Makefile commands    |

### ðŸ“‚ Folder & File Highlights

```
ch1/
â”œâ”€â”€ hello.go              # Hello World program
â”œâ”€â”€ go.mod                # Module initialization file
â”œâ”€â”€ Makefile              # Automation script for build/test/lint
â””â”€â”€ README.md             # Chapter-wise documentation (auto-generated)
```

### ðŸ§ª Makefile Used

```makefile
.DEFAULT_GOAL := build
.PHONY: fmt vet build clean

fmt:
	go fmt ./...

vet: fmt
	go vet ./...

build: vet
	go build -o hello_world

clean:
	rm -f hello_world
```

Run commands:
```bash
make         # runs fmt â†’ vet â†’ build
make clean   # cleans up binary
```

### ðŸ§  Enterprise Reflections

- This chapter represents a **foundational milestone** in infrastructure readiness.  
- Goâ€™s tooling allows setting up a **complete dev + CI loop** with just a few CLI commands.  
- Unlike larger ecosystems, Go's **first-class CLI** (fmt, vet, build, mod) removes the need for third-party tooling early on.  
- Makefiles + GitHub Actions give you **pipeline parity between local dev and production CI**.  
- The simplicity and predictability of the toolchain reduce onboarding time in cross-functional teams.

---

### ðŸ“Œ Takeaways

- âœ… Prefer official Go installation over package managers for long-term stability  
- âœ… Always use `go mod` for module-based development  
- âœ… Standardize formatting and validation using Make + CLI  
- âœ… Write `Makefile` targets even for small repos â€” future CI/CD becomes plug-and-play  
- âœ… Use GitHub Actions early to mimic enterprise pipelines from day one
