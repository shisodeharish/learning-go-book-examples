## 🚀 Why I Started Learning Go

After 13+ years as a backend developer, I wanted to go deeper into system-level backend performance, concurrency, and cloud-native design. Go (Golang) stood out for its simplicity and power.

---

## 📚 Book I Followed  

I chose the book **"Learning Go" by Jon Bodner** and decided to build a structured public GitHub repository as I went through each chapter.

---

## 📂 My GitHub Repo

🔗 [learning-go-book-examples](https://github.com/your-username/learning-go-book-examples)  

Each chapter has its own folder (`ch1`, `ch2`, ...), and includes:

- Code examples  
- `Makefile` for automation  
- Clean formatting (`go fmt`, `go vet`)  
- Exercises  
- GitHub Actions  

---

## ✅ What I Learned from Chapter 1

- Installed Go and set up environment correctly  
- Created first Go module  
- Learned to automate build/test with Makefile  
- Used `go fmt` and `go vet` to enforce quality  
- Committed code to GitHub with version control

---

## ⚙️ What’s Next

- Finish the full book in 30 days  
- Add GitHub Projects to track progress  
- Build a real Go product (Vault, CLI agent, REST API)  
- Write weekly blogs on the journey

---

## 🎯 Final Thoughts

This approach helped me:

- Stay focused  
- Build a habit  
- Create tangible proof of progress  
- Stand out in interviews
